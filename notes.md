## ML concepts

### Supervised : always has one or multiple targets
	- Regression : predicting a value
	- Classification : predicting a category

### UnSupervised : does not have any target
	- Example : Credit Fraud detection 
	- important appproaches :
		- clustering
		- PCA
		- t-SNE

### Cross Validation : ensures that the model fits and does not overfit
	- k fold cross validation
		- can be used with all kind of datasets
		- splits any dataest into k folds
	- stratified k fold cross validation
		- when data set is skewed (examples 90% ppositive samples, 10% negative samples)
		- keeps the ratio of labels in each fold constant
		- if it's a stamdard classification problem, choose it blindly
	- hold out based validation
		- 
	- leave one out cross validation
	- group k-fold cross validation
